# Grow A Forest

> The bot isn't finished nor playable and its development has been discontinued. This repository was made available because someone might benefit from it someday.

Grow A Forest (GAF) is a Discord game bot written in Rust. Its purpose is to build a forest by regularly sending trees in text channels. 
Server administrators have full control over the forest growing in their server.

Before discontinuing its development, I had a few good ideas of things to add to the bot. Sadly, they will not come to life unless I decide to resume the project in the future.
